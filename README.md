# AICTE-Image-classification
This is a Streamlit-based web application that provides an intuitive interface for performing image classification using pre-trained deep learning models. 

The app supports two types of models:
MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet) for classifying real-world images into 1,000 categories.
Custom CIFAR-10 model for classifying images into 10 classes, including airplane, automobile, bird, cat, dog, and more.

image_classification_app.py: Main application code.
cifar10_model.h5: Pre-trained CIFAR-10 model (ensure to place it in the root directory).
requirements.txt: Python dependencies required to run the app.
